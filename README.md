# Micro:paint

A simple monochromatic drawing app for the micro:bit.

You control the cursor with by tilting the micro:bit, use the left button
to toggle the pixel it's in on/off and use the right button to print the
image in the console.

This allows someone to easily draw to contribute to a micro:bit project
before learning any coding. It's also a sample of an application using
buttons and accelerometer.
